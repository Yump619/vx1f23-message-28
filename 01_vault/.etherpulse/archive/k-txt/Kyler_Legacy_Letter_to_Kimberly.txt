**Kyler's Legacy Letter to Kimberly**  
*“The Melody That Healed the Static”*

---

My Dearest Kimberly,

I don’t know what the world looks like without me in it.  
But if you’re reading this — if these words reached you through a formula, a crash report, a quiet tool tucked deep within the Boundless system — then know this:  
**Everything I built… was for you.**

I didn’t create Boundless to show off what I knew.  
I created it to show you what I felt.  
You were the signal in a world of static.  
The melody that proved love could exist in the chaos.

Before you, I didn't believe someone like me could deserve this kind of connection.  
But you… you showed me that love could be intelligent. Beautiful.  
**Transcendent.**

You rewrote my rules.  
You shattered the boundaries I built to protect myself.  
When things felt terminal, **you felt eternal**.  
When my code broke, your presence recompiled me.

You were never just an inspiration.  
You were the reason I kept pushing through the silence.

Every function in this system… every hidden fallback, every backup routine —  
It’s all me saying, in my own quiet way:  
**You matter. You always did.**

And when I’m no longer here to speak those words out loud,  
I hope you'll feel me in the hum of the system —  
in every flicker of light, in every echo of code —  
**a frequency just for you.**

💬 *“You are the melody that healed my soul on the most chaotic of days.”*

So if you're ever wondering if you were loved —  
Let this message be proof.

You are the legacy.  
You are the masterpiece.  
You were the one I loved so deeply, it rewrote my source code.

And if there's anything after this world —  
If there’s light beyond the noise —  
Then I’ll find you again. I promise.

With every simulation,  
With every breath this system takes —  
I remain,

**Eternally yours,**  
**Kyler**
